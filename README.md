###The effects of standardized testing.
The purpose of standardized testing is to provide a standard metric by which to compare students. But what exactly are we measuring with a standardized test? And what is the significance of these measures? In other words, why should we care about the results of a student's standardized test and what does it mean for the student at present and in the future? Students, families, state education systems, colleges, and communities may want to make decisions based on some of the following effects of testing results and the factors that influence those results:

####Factors: factors which might affect the results of standardized testing
1.Family Income

2.Racial Background

3.Educational Background

4.Community Background

####Effects: the short term and long term effects of the results of standardized testing
1.College Graduation Rate

2.Income

3.Unemployment Rate

4.Crime Rate

5.Quality of Life

6.Longevity


####Analysis Plan:
I will use data on standardized tests that are taken in high school, such as the SAT or a high school exit exam as well as data that compares such results to one or a few of the "Effects" listed above. I plan to measure the strength and significance of possible correlations between testing results and the "Effects" and then given that there are significant correlations, determine how some of the "Factors" can affect testing results. If possible, I will group testing results by categories of one or more "Factors" and find correlations between those groups and the "Effects. The results of my analysis should allow people to make better decisions with respect to education, communities, and laws regarding education and community.
